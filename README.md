# MS-Rewards
It's a project which partially automates the bing searching process to earn point in the Microsoft Rewards program.
The process is semi automatic.
The powershell file runs the bing searches, each search in individual tab. The searches are made from a list of words in the currentlist.txt.
The exe file generates the currentfile.txt from the list.txt
The list.txt contains list of unique words each with 11 letters.
